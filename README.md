# Sliding 8 Game / Solver

A fun little side project where I created a basic Sliding 8 puzzle game and solver using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space, which can be shifted to solve the puzzle.

## Features
- **Interactive Game**: Play the Sliding 8 puzzle by moving tiles.
- **Solver**: An algorithm that can solve the puzzle automatically.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with minimalistic design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: To create the structure of the game and puzzle grid.
- **CSS**: For styling the game and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, tile movements, and puzzle-solving algorithm.

## How to Play
1. Arrange the tiles by sliding them one step at a time.
2. The goal is to arrange the tiles in order, from 1 to 8, with the empty space at the bottom-right corner.
3. Click or tap on the tiles adjacent to the empty space to move them.

## How the Solver Works
- The solver uses a A* algorithm to find the optimal solution for the given puzzle configuration.
- You can either manually solve the puzzle or use the solver to automatically arrange the tiles in the correct order.
